/*Write a function that keeps track of guests that are going to a house party.

You will be given an array of strings. Each string will be one of the following:

- "{name} is going!"

- "{name} is not going!"

If you receive the first type of input, you have to add the person if he/she is not in the list (If he/she is in the list print: "{name} is already in the list!").

If you receive the second type of input, you have to remove the person if he/she is in the list (if not print: "{name} is not in the list!").

At the end print all the guests each on a separate line. */
